In this experiment we are asked to implement a hospital management system. We are given the 
current patient and admission lists. We take an input file and use the commends inside of it to manage the 
patient list, creating admissions, adding examinations to that admissions, and calculating the total 
examinations cost of admissions. And also we updated the admission and patient list after the changes.
